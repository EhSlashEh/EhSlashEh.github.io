    <!--Hey what are you doing, poking around these parts! There's only enough room on this website for one developer. '-->
    <h1>Howdy Partner!</h1>

    <p>I am going to upload all my cool stuff here. I am currently working on my first game, Color Runner! It's a pretty straightforward game where you are a bean that changes colors to match the obstacles.</p>

    <p>You can check it out here!</p>

    <div class="game-flexbox">
        
        <iframe src="https://itch.io/embed-upload/7346113?color=333333"
                    frameborder="0"
                    allowfullscreen
                    width="1430"
                    height="830">
            </iframe>

    </div>

    <p> If the game is slow on your browser, you can download it <a href="https://ehslasheh.itch.io/color-runner">here.</a></p>

    <p> I will keep updating this page with cool stuff I'm working on, so  bookmark this site!</p>
